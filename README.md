# CloudUploader
A basic project for uploading files to cloud server using CLI
Designed to be easy to use, no code required from the end user.
You will need an environment that supports bash commands, such as Ubuntu via WSL.
First, run the setup script to install Azure CLI, then the region Lister to get a list of regions (this is optional if you already know which regions are used in Azure)
